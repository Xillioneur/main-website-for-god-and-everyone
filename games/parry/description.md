# Ashes of the Bullet: The Rite of Temperance

**Ashes of the Bullet** is an intensive exercise in patience and the mastery of the self. In this manifestation, the seeker is surrounded by a storm of chaos, finding peace and victory through the sacred act of the parry.

### Spiritual & Technical Architecture
- **The Gracious Parry**: The core ritual centers on a timing-based window that transforms external threats into instruments of justice, reflecting the ability of the soul to convert trials into triumphs.
- **The Altar of Ascension**: Souls gathered from the void are sacrificed to augment the seeker’s intrinsic virtues—Vitality, Endurance, Strength, and Dexterity—mirroring the constant refinement of the human spirit.
- **Geometries of the Storm**: Projectile patterns manifest in Archimedean spirals and walls, testing the seeker's ability to perceive order within apparent disorder.
- **The Ultimate Adversary**: Features the "Bullet Lord," a multi-phase manifestation that demands ever-increasing levels of focus and spiritual clarity.
