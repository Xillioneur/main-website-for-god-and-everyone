# Ashes of the Bullet (Dark Souls Edition)

**Ashes of the Bullet** is a punishing Bullet Hell Arena manifestation that merges rapid-fire projectiles with the high-stakes risk/reward cycle of a Soulslike journey.

### Technical Manifestation
- **Reflective Parry System**: The core ritual involves a timing-based parry window that transforms enemy threats into player assets, deflecting bullets with a `PERFECT_PARRY_BONUS` multiplier.
- **Sacred RPG Stats**: Implements a persistent soul-collection loop. Gathered essence is sacrificed at "Sites of Grace" to augment Vitality, Endurance, Strength, and Dexterity via a custom upgrade logic.
- **Bullet Patterns**: Sophisticated procedural spawning of complex projectile matrices, including Archimedean spirals and directional walls.
- **Dynamic Camera**: A 3D orbital camera system featuring smooth lerp following and intensity-based trauma (shake) during high-impact events.
- **Boss Phase Logic**: Features the "Bullet Lord" manifestation, utilizing a multi-phase state machine that adapts its attack patterns based on health thresholds.

Git Gud. The code demands nothing less. Selah.
