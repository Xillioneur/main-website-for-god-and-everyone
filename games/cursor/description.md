# Cursor - Ascend the Code

**Cursor** is a pinnacle manifestation of modern C++23, pushing the extreme limits of WebAssembly through true parallel processing and advanced shader alchemy.

### Technical Manifestation
- **Multithreaded Architecture**: Utilizes a custom **ThreadPool** to distribute the threads of creation across multiple CPU cores. Heavy compute tasks—including AI pathfinding, collision matrices, and 2000+ particle physics—are offloaded via `std::thread`.
- **Atomic Synchronization**: Employs `std::atomic` and thread-safe command buffers to maintain sacred state consistency between the main rendering loop and background worker manifestations.
- **WebGL 2.0 Pipeline**: Manages a high-performance GLES 3.0 graphics pipeline featuring a custom **CRT Post-Processing Shader** with curvature, chromatic aberration, and scanline artifacts.
- **Procedural Sound Engine**: Audio is manifested at runtime through custom synth waveforms (Sine, Square, Triangle, Noise) using direct sample buffer manipulation.
- **Advanced AI & Physics**: Enemies feature sophisticated obstacle avoidance logic and predictive movement, all running in parallel to ensure a consistent 60 FPS manifestation.

Witness the power of the Divine Multi-Core. Amen.
