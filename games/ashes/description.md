# Ashes of the Scroll

**Ashes of the Scroll** is a high-fidelity 3D action RPG manifestation, deeply inspired by the "Soulslike" genre. It pushes the boundaries of web-based manifestations through complex physics and intricate combat logic.

### Technical Manifestation
- **Advanced Combat Engine**: Implements a frame-perfect hit detection system with light/heavy attack strings, stamina-gated actions, and a robust poise/stagger mechanic.
- **Precision Movement**: Features a "Perfect Roll" system utilizing invincibility frames (i-frames) and easing-function-based dodging.
- **Sophisticated AI**: Enemies operate on a multi-state machine (Patrol, Alert, Chase, Search, Staggered) with type-specific behaviors including strafing, blocking, and reactive dodging.
- **Targeting Matrix**: Includes a full 3D lock-on system with intelligent target-switching based on mouse flick velocity and angular scoring.
- **Visual Alchemy**: Custom particle emitters for blood/sparks, dynamic weapon trails, and a lerp-smoothed cinematic camera with impact-reactive screen shake.
- **Level Architecture**: Two distinct manifestations including an open field populated via mt19937 random distribution and a dedicated Boss Arena.

Seek the truth within the code. Let your skills be your guide. Amen.
