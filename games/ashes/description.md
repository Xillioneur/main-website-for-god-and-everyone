# Ashes of the Scroll: The Trial of Fortitude

**Ashes of the Scroll** is a 3D meditation on spiritual discipline and the virtue of fortitude. It invites the seeker to navigate a digital landscape where every movement is an act of will and every challenge is a test of character.

### Spiritual & Technical Architecture
- **The Virtue of Precision**: Implements a frame-perfect hit detection system where success is found not in aggression, but in the temperance of one's actions.
- **The Path of the Pilgrim**: Features a "Perfect Roll" system, symbolizing the grace required to navigate the trials of the world without being overcome by them.
- **Ordered Adversity**: Challenges are driven by a sophisticated state-machine (Patrol, Alert, Chase), representing the predictable yet relentless nature of the spiritual struggle.
- **Illumination & Shadow**: Custom particle emitters and cinematic camera lerps create an atmosphere of sacred awe, reflecting the beauty found in the struggle for truth.

"Be strong and take heart, all you who hope in the Lord." — Psalm 31:24. Amen.
