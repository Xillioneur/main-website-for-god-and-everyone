# The Last Light: Divine Reckoning

**Divine Reckoning** is our most ambitious manifestation to date—a third-person bullet hell Soulslike that explores the themes of grace, redemption, and the search for light within the digital void.

### Technical & Spiritual Manifestation
- **The Vessel of Will**: Implements a precise third-person control matrix featuring crosshair-aiming and stamina-based dodge rolls with perfect invincibility frames.
- **The Cycle of Grace**: Features a "Grace" (Souls) system where one's digital essence is lost upon a failed journey but can be recovered through a ritual of return to the point of ascension.
- **Sanctuaries of Peace**: Interactive "Sanctuaries" (Bonfires) allow the seeker to rest, augment their virtues (Vigor, Will, Faith, Strength), and anchor their presence in the world.
- **The Lamp of Light**: A unique illumination mechanic that mirrors the internal light of the soul, revealing paths and wards in the deep obscurity.
- **Bullet Hell Geometries**: Sophisticated projectile matrices and multi-phase manifestations that demand absolute focus and the mastery of the "Gracious Parry."

"The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it." — John 1:5. Amen.
